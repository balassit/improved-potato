### Behavioral Questions

Nuggest first then S.A.R

- negget first: respond with a nugget that succinctly describes what your response will be about
- S.A.R (Situation, Action, Result): outline situation, explain action taken, describe result

- not too many details in situation
- action is most important, break into multiple parts where possible
- think about what it says about me

|         | Nugget | Situation | Action(s) | Result | What it says |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Story 1 |        |           |           |        |              |
| Story 2 |        |           |           |        |              |


About me: a pitch
1. current role - headline only. I am a software engineer at Capital One. I moved to Seattle a year ago and work for the 401k team
as a full stack developer.
2. College - My background is in computer science. I completed my undergrad at NC State and completed my summer internship at
a local biomedical company.
3. Post college: In 2017, I lived in Richmond, VA and worked on an internal team to Capital One. I learned a lot about DevOps and 
gained more experience in java and automated testing a UI.
4. Current role details: I took took advantage of Capital One's TDP which allowed me move out to Seattle,
after being promoted, to join my team which was an amazing opportunity. I have been designing a brand 
new platform from the ground up in AWS which will be used as a customer facing quote and sales funnel 
along with the supporting applications necessary to run the platform from a business standpoint.
I have been fortunate enough to have my hands in the design for nearly the entire platform and
have focused my development on the front-end in the early stages.
5. Outside of work: I have started contributing to GitHub Actions which is in public beta. This has been the first large open source project
that I have contributed to. I also have been working on a application with my brother which would enable users to have a door to door
laundry delivery service.
5a. Hobbies
6. My team has been amazing, and I have been given a lot of responsibilities in leading the team. As they pivot to a new company,
I am looking for new opportunites to join a team that works at scale. I love the contributions that Google has made to the world, 
and believe in their [mission](https://www.google.com/about/). To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.



### General Interview Tips

1. Explain - We want to understand how you think, so explain your thought process and decision
making throughout the interview. Remember we’re not only evaluating your technical ability,
but also how you solve problems. Explicitly state and check assumptions with your interviewer
to ensure they are reasonable.
2. Clarify - Many questions will be deliberately open-ended to provide insight into what
categories and information you value within the technological puzzle. We’re looking to see
how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to talk
through your thought process and feel free to ask specific questions if you need clarification.
3. Improve - Think about ways to improve the solution you present. It’s worthwhile to think out
loud about your initial thoughts to a question. In many cases, your first answer may need some
refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve
on it — just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why.
4. Practice - You won’t have access to an IDE or compiler during the interview so practice
writing code on paper or a whiteboard. Be sure to test your code and ensure it’s easily
readable without bugs. Don’t stress about small syntactical errors like which substring to use
for a given method (e.g. start, end or start, length) — just pick one and let your interviewer
know.

### The Coding & Algorithm Interviews

1. Algorithms - Approach the problem with both bottom-up and top-down algorithms. You will
be expected to know the complexity of an algorithm and how you can improve/change it.
Algorithms that are used to solve Google problems include sorting (plus searching and binary
search), divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memoization, greediness, recursion or
algorithms linked to a specific data structure. Know Big-O notations (e.g. run time) and be
ready to discuss complex algorithms like Dijkstra and A*. We recommend discussing or
outlining the algorithm you have in mind before writing code.
2. Sorting - Be familiar with common sorting functions and on what kind of input data they’re
efficient on or not. Think about efficiency means in terms of runtime and space used. For
example, in exceptional cases insertion-sort or radix-sort are much better than the generic
QuickSort/MergeSort/HeapSort answers.
3. Data structures - You should study up on as many data structures as possible. Data
structures most frequently used are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash-sets, hash-maps,
hash-tables, dictionary, trees and binary trees, heaps and graphs. You should know the data
structure inside out, and what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure.
4. Mathematics - Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent
at Google than at other companies because counting problems, probability problems and
other Discrete Math 101 situations surround us. Spend some time before the interview
refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of elementary probability
theory and combinatorics. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk.
5. Graphs - Consider if a problem can be applied with graph algorithms like distance, search,
connectivity, cycle-detection, etc. There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory
(objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list) — familiarize yourself with each
representation and its pros and cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms,
breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their
tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code.
6. Recursion - Many coding problems involve thinking recursively and potentially coding a
recursive solution. Use recursion to find more elegant solutions to problems that can be
solved iteratively.

### The Large Scale Design Interview

1. System Design - Questions are used to assess a candidate's ability to combine knowledge,
theory, experience and judgement toward solving a real-world engineering problem. In other
words, can a candidate "design policies, processes, procedures, methods, tests, and/or
components from ground up.
Sample topics include: features sets, interfaces, class hierarchies, distributed systems,
designing a system under certain constraints, simplicity, limitations, robustness and tradeoffs.
You should also have an understanding of how the internet actually works and be familiar with
the various pieces (routers, domain name servers, load balancers, firewalls, etc.). Other topics
include: traverse a graphs, run-time complexity of graphs, distributed hash table system,
resource estimation with real systems, big product design picture, translation of an abstract
problem to a system, API discussions, binary trees, cache, mapreduce, for loop problems,
index, reverse link-list, compilers, memory cache, networks and also common topics.
2. Operating Systems - You should understand processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks,
mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they all work. Understand deadlock, livelock and
how to avoid them. Know what resources a process needs and a thread needs. Understand
how context switching works, how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying
hardware. Know a little about scheduling. We are rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know
the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.

### How Google Hires

- no brain teasers
- resume should be consise. has no errors or mistakes. 
- resume bullet points convey impact

### [Preparing for Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko-KkSmp-Lk)

- for design question: work with interviewer to create high level system and if applicable go into deeper questions. 
- analysis question: show you understand all aspects of the problem and if necessary offer multiple solutions with relative merits
- api, object oriented design, programming, how to test, corner cases, algorithms, complexity (time and space) how to change it. For testing: how would you unit test. what interesting inputs. design end to end integration, load and performance, security tests for real world apps like gmail.
- data structures and algorithms: all! np complete (traveling salesman, knapsack). suffix trees and the bin packing problem optional (I found these later)
- math: discrete math. counting problems, probability, combinatorics, n choose k
- recursion
- operating systems
- how search works
