# Data Structures

## Arrays

Use case: 
1. excessive read, as time complexity is always O(1)
2. Random access to element using index

ArrayList:
excessive read, random access using index, more flexible in coding, 
effective use of memory space as items get allocated as needed

### Average Time Complexity
Access - 1
Search - n
Insert - n
Delete - n

### Space Complexity - O(n)

## Linked Lists

Use case:
1. Effective use of memory space as items get allocated as needed
2. excessive add/remove of elements. Better than ArrayList because items would be shifted in ArrayList, 
with linked lists the new item gets injected in the list without the need to shift the other items as they are not adjacent in memory

### Average Time Complexity
Access - n
Search - n
Insert - 1
Delete - 1

### Space Complexity - O(n)

## Stacks

### Average Time Complexity
Access - n
Search - n
Insert - 1
Delete - 1

### Space Complexity - O(n)

## Queues

### Average Time Complexity
Access - n
Search - n
Insert - 1
Delete - 1

### Space Complexity - O(n)

## Hash Tables

Effective for lookupsg

### Average Time Complexity
Access - N/A
Search - 1
Insert - 1
Delete - 1

Worst case us O(n) for all

### Space Complexity - O(n) 

## Sorting

### Merge sort
### Quick sort
### Bubble sort
### Insertion sort
### Selection sort
### Radix sort
